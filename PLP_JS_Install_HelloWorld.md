# JavaScript

JavaScript is primarily used with web applications. We will be going over how to run JavaScript code independently of other web based languages.

# Installation

Node.js can be installed on any operating system to run JavaScript code. NodeJS can we installed from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

To check if you already have Node.js installed you can open a command prompt and type:

	node -v

If you already have Node.js installed it will tell you what version you are running, if not it will give an error message.

If you don't want to run your code from the command line, JavaScript is also supported on a number of integrated development environments (IDEs), which come with additional features such as built in debugging and git integration.
To see a list of the most popular IDEs go to: https://jaxenter.com/top-5-javascript-ide-146609.html

Many of these IDEs have a cost associated with them, but some also offer free versions to students, such as JetBrain's Webstorm IDE.

You can install both an IDE and Node.js to run your code; these are not mutually exclusive.

# Creating and Running JavaScript

JavaScript can be written in any text editor, although it is easier to write in an editor that has additional features such as Notepad++. If you are coding in a text editor you need to run your programs through the command line.
If your program is called Hello_World.js open a command prompt, navigate to the folder that your file is in, and type:

	node Hello_World.js
	
# Writing JavaScript

JavaScript does not have much boilerplate code. 

The hello world program in JavaScript would look like:

	console.log("Hello, World!");
	
This is simply the console.log command which prints to the console with a semi colon to end the line.
