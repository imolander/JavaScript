# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level loosley typed programming language that was designed for web development. It is interpreted, not compiled, and does not use a virtual machine.
As one might guess from the name, it is a scripting language with object oriented capabilites. 



# History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich and Netscape in 1995. At the time webpages were static, and they create JavaScript to allow for dynamic content.

# Usage

JavaScript is know as a web programming language, as such it is primarily used for web-based applications and web browsers. It can be used to add interactvity to a website, create mobile or web apps, build a web server, or even game development.

The most popular Github.com projects related to JavaScript right now are:
1. An open source codebase and curriculum https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp
2. A framework for building UI on the web https://github.com/vuejs/vue
3. A library for building user interfaces https://github.com/facebook/react

#Resources

For my work this semster, I will primarily be using "JavaScript The Definitive Guide 7th Edition" and the documentation provided by Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript. I will also be supplementing this with sources from w3schools.com and codeacademy.com.
Additionally, I may use StackOverflow.com as a last resort, but will try to be cautious of incorrect answers.
